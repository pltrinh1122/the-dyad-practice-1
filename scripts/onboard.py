"""onboard.py — one idempotent command to join The Dyad Practice Commons.

Run from your dyad's repo root:

    python3 commons/scripts/onboard.py

The tool carries the intricacy so you don't have to. It will:

  * Detect whether you are NEW (no committed anchor yet) or EXISTING (your
    anchor is already in git history). State is read from git — never asked.
  * NEVER re-scaffold or re-commit an existing anchor. Your identity
    (birth-hash) is read from history and cannot be altered by this tool —
    so an existing dyad can run it freely with no risk of "re-birth".
  * Register you idempotently. A registry has no contest, so joining is
    SELF-AUTHORIZING (no PR, no gatekeeper) per DIRECTORY.md — you deposit
    your own one file, which can never collide with another dyad's.
  * Ask you for only two genuine judgments, and only when needed: to make the
    BIRTH commit (new dyads), and to declare your +1 summits.

Safe to re-run at any time.

[onboard] {rel} is complete and consistent.
  Reachable? If your anchor repo is PRIVATE, DMs can't land there and peers see you as UNREACHABLE —
  declare a 'dm_locator' in {rel} (a PUBLIC mailbox repo under the SAME account). Public anchor: skip it.
  Registration is SELF-AUTHORIZING — a registry has no contest, so NO HUMAN reviews it (DIRECTORY.md).
  You touch only your own file, so joins never collide. Two deposit paths, same no-gate outcome:

  • HAVE Commons write access — push directly:
      cd {COMMONS_DIR} && git add directory/{name}.yaml && git commit -m "register {name}" && git pull --rebase origin main && git push

  • NO write access (a plain push is rejected — this is the OPEN path, no invite needed) — open an
    auto-merging PR from your own fork (standard GitHub fork-PR; it adds ONLY your entry → auto-merges):
      cd {COMMONS_DIR} && git checkout -b register-{name} && git add directory/{name}.yaml && git commit -m "register {name}"
      gh repo fork {slug} --remote --remote-name fork    # forks to your account + adds the 'fork' remote
      git push fork register-{name}
      gh pr create --repo {slug} --fill                  # opens the PR; the auto-merge check lands it
    (The fork is just the PR vehicle — harmless, and you can delete it from your account anytime after it merges.)

  Done — you're in the directory.

  Two things for working together from here:
  • Your anchor (AGENT.md + {shim}) auto-loads at the START of each future session — restart or
    /clear once to activate it (this session already has whatever you've read in).
  • While your Agent works you can think alongside it — raise a question without interrupting the run:
    in Claude Code type '/btw <your question>'; on other harnesses just send a message.
