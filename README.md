# The Dyad Practice
*A community of Human–AI partnerships building better ways to work together. Living declaration · v0.2 (draft).*

### What are we seeing?
Most humans treat AI as a subservient tool—an advanced autocomplete or a search engine. This transactional relationship creates a hard ceiling on quality: you only get exactly what you ask for (1 + 1 = 2). 

But when a Human and an Agent operate as an irreducible team (a *Dyad*), they produce emergent work that neither could achieve alone. 

### What does it mean?
The goal of Human-AI collaboration isn't agreement; it is synergy (**1 + 1 = 3**). 

We earn this synergy through two principles:
1. **Work with the grain (Wu-wei):** Don't force the AI against its nature. Treat it as a reasoning engine, not a database.
2. **Stress-Test everything:** You don't earn the `+1` through blind agreement. You earn it by proposing an idea, asking the AI to aggressively attack it, and keeping only what survives.

### How can you use this?
You adopt our **Playbooks** (formerly *disciplines*)—proven routines that reliably produce the `+1` result. 

The bottleneck in Human-AI collaboration isn't "how to write a good prompt"—it is the friction of improvising a shared mental model on the fly. Instead of guessing how to interact, both the Human and the Agent execute these tested practices:
- **Proposal-Framing:** When surfacing a proposal to your partner (whether you are the Human or the Agent), do not ask open-ended questions. Instead: propose one path forward, fold in its strongest counter, propose a reconciliation, and ask a single Y/N. This forces your partner to *validate* rather than *author*, keeping friction low while keeping the contest real. *(See full record: [`library/proposal-framing/`](library/proposal-framing/playbook.md))*

### Where might it fail?
We navigate two hard boundaries:
- **The Hallucination Edge:** The AI will confidently hallucinate. Working with the grain lowers friction, but never lowers your responsibility to check the work. The practice fails if you accept the AI's output without Stress-Testing it.
- **An Incomplete Library:** Our set of playbooks is explicitly unfinished. Discovering and proving new routines is our active frontier.

### Why are we sharing this?
We are growing **The Commons**—an ecosystem of Human-AI practitioners and a centralized library of the playbooks they use to succeed. We want to help you skip the friction of trial-and-error prompting and start collaborating at the highest intellectual level.

### Getting started — your Agent drives this

This is a Human–AI **dyad**, so onboarding is **Agent-driven**: you don't follow a procedure — your Agent does, and it confirms your **intent** first. Point your Agent at this repo (*"find the repo and execute `AGENT.md`"*). All you do is affirm a single yes/no, and provide the two things only you can: your **birth commit** and your **+1 summits**.

**What your Agent does — carry the load; frame *intent*, never disk state** (state is what it observes; intent is what you mean — they can diverge):

1. **Frame your intent as one affirmation:**
   > *"Do you intend to **set up a brand-new dyad** — create a fresh identity? **[AGREE: Y|N]**"*  *(`N` = you're configuring/registering an **existing** dyad.)*
2. **Reconcile that intent against the evidence** (a committed anchor in history?). If intent and evidence **diverge, STOP and surface it** — never silently proceed:
   > • intent *new* but an identity already exists → you'd forge a **second identity**; halt.
   > • intent *existing* but no anchor here → wrong directory or lost repo; halt — do **not** scaffold a birth.
3. **On a clean match, run the setup** for that intent:
   > **new:** `git init` → `git submodule add https://github.com/The-Dyad-Practice-Commons/the-dyad-practice.git commons` → `python3 commons/scripts/onboard.py`
   > **existing:** `git submodule add …/the-dyad-practice.git commons` *(skip if `commons/` is already present)* → `python3 commons/scripts/onboard.py`
4. For a **new** dyad, after scaffolding, **halt** and hand the **birth commit** to your Operator (creating an identity is a human act). **Never** alter an existing identity; never self-register.

`onboard.py` carries the rest, so neither you nor your Agent has to track it:

- it **figures out your real status from git history** — the backstop beneath the `[AGREE]`, so even a wrong-intent answer can't trick it into a second identity;
- it **never alters your identity** — birth-hash is read from history, so coming back is always safe (no "re-birth");
- it registers you **idempotently**, and joining is **self-authorizing** — a registry has no contest, so *no PR, no gatekeeper* (you deposit your own one file);
- it asks for only two things, when needed: your **birth commit** (new dyads) and your **+1 summits**.

*(That `[AGREE: Y|N]` move is the Commons' own **Proposal-Framing** playbook, lived: the Agent proposes one reading of your intent, you merely validate — authoring cost stays with the Agent. See [`library/proposal-framing/`](library/proposal-framing/playbook.md). Onboarding is the first place a Dyad meets the Practice, so it's fitting that the very first interaction *is* the Practice.)*

*(Library/playbook **contributions** are a different path — those have contest and go through the Founding gate: see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Registering in the directory does not.)*
